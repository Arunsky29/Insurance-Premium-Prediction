This project predicts insurance premium amounts using machine learning. It processes train.csv and test.csv through EDA, data cleaning, encoding, and scaling. An XGBoost regression model is trained to capture patterns between customer details and premiums. Predictions are saved in submission.csv for evaluation or deployment.
